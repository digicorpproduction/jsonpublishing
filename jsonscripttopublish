JSON file publishing

Steps to use any of these methods:

Save your JSON data to a file named resume.json
Choose one of the above methods
Run the server:

For Python: python server.py
For Node.js: node server.js (after running npm install express)
For PHP: Place the file in your web server directory and access it through your local PHP server


Access your JSON:

Python: http://localhost:8000/resume.json
Node.js: http://localhost:3000/resume
PHP: http://localhost/your_php_file.php



The Python method is probably the quickest to get started with since it doesn't require installing any dependencies. Would you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?

JSON Local Server with PythonClick to open code
Let me break down how to use this script:

Save Your JSON Data
First, make sure your JSON data (like the resume we created) is saved in a file (e.g., resume.json) in the same directory as the script.
Run the Server
Basic usage:

bashCopypython server.py
With options:
bashCopypython server.py --port 8080 --file custom.json --no-browser

Access Your JSON


Open your browser to http://localhost:8000 (or whatever port you specified)
Use curl: curl http://localhost:8000
Or access it from your web applications

Key Features of the Script:

CORS Support: Enables cross-origin requests
Error Handling: Graceful handling of file and server errors
Command Line Options:

--port: Choose custom port
--file: Specify JSON file to serve
--no-browser: Prevent automatic browser opening


Clean Shutdown: Handles Ctrl+C gracefully

Common Use Cases:

Testing API integrations locally
Development environment for web applications
Sharing JSON data with other local applications

Common Issues and Solutions:

Port Already in Use:
bashCopypython server.py --port 8001  # Try a different port

File Not Found:

Make sure the JSON file is in the same directory as the script
Use absolute path: python server.py --file /path/to/your/file.json


Permission Issues:

Make sure you have read permissions for the JSON file
Run with appropriate user permissions
